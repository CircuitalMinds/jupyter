For this calculation we choose a basis of 1 gmol of $CH_4$ because no amount of reactant or product was specified. Next, we apply material balances. Because all of the $CH_4$ is reacted and no excess $O_2$ is used, the mole balances are relatively simple. From the reaction equation, one mole of $CO_2$ and two moles of $H_2O$ are formed from the complete combustion of 1 gmol of $CH_4$ and the $N_2$ in the air used leaves in the product gas. Because 3 moles of $O_2$ are required to consume one mole of CH4 and air is approximately 79 mol% $N_2$, 11.2857 moles of $N_2$ (i.e., (3/0.21) 0.79) leave in the product gas."]},{"metadata":{"slideshow":{"slide_type":"fragment"},"id":"lb5lTFiozTiS","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"cell_type":"code","source":["import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","%matplotlib inline\n","\n","n = dict()\n","n['CO2'] = 1\n","n['H2O'] = 2\n","n['N2'] = 3*(.79/0.21)\n","\n","for k in n.keys(): \n","    print(\"n[{:3s}] =  {:5.2f}\".format(k,n[k]))"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"slideshow":{"slide_type":"slide"},"id":"dJMNlnQLzTiY","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Now consider the energy balance for this system.
