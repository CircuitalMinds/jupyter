## Study Guide for Exam 1

You can expect to see four problems on the exam, roughly distributed according to the following topics. 

### 1. Control Concepts

* Review Lectures 01 and 02. Be sure you can identify components of a control and classify process variables.
* Degree of Freedom Analysis.
* Review Chapter 1 of the textbook.  
* Problem 1.2, 1.6, 1.9, 1.11, 1.12

### 2. Control Strategies ###

* Review Lectures 03, 04, and Textbook Sections 2.1 to 2.3.
* Identify Feedback vs. Feedforward control. 
* Understand the difference between setpoint tracking and disturbance rejection.
* Describe each of the three terms in a PID control loop.
* Analyze the performance of a PID control loop, and determine if proportional, integral, or derivative components need to be adjusted.

### 3. Modeling Principles ###

* Review Textbook Section 2.4, the Bioreactor example from problem 2.15
* Be able to interpret a Simulink model and draw correspondence to a system of differential equations.
* Be able to use mass and energy balances to construct simple models of lumped processes.
* Textbook problems 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.8, 2.12, 2.13

### 4. Linearization ###

* Textbook section 4.4, examples 4.6, 4.7, 4.8
