    "\n",
    "This is an individual exam. All work must be your own, absolutely no collaboration on the answers is allowed. The prohibition applies to conversations, emails, texts, hints, etc. To repeat, this is an individual exam to be taken in the same manner as any in-class exam.\n",

    "Any questions to the instructor should be directed through the forum feature on the Sakai web page for the course. The purpose is to provide all students with the same access to interactions with the instructor. The instructor may choose to respond to a particularly significant question by group email, but will attempt to keep those interruptions to a minimum.\n",
